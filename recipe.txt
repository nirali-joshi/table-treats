Strawberry Mocktail

Ingredients: 
Strawbeeries
limes
mint leaves
2-3 tsp honey
Sprite or 7-up

preparation time:
10 min

method:
Step-1 : Combine the strawberries, lime juice, mint leaves, and sweetener into a bowl/jug and muddle well or use a blender to make puree.

Step-2 : Optionally, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer. Alternatively, simply add large ice cubes to the glass and top up with soda. Stir Well.

Tips:
Optionally garnish with additional lemon/lime slices or even cucumber.

If you don’t want to use Sprite, use Ginger ale or 7 UP. I used Sprite because to me it tastes sweeter. If you use something besides Sprite, just note you might want to add a couple tablespoons of sugar to the pitcher.

Choco brownie thick shake

image : https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodieist.com%2Fhow-to-make-momos-at-home-step-by-step%2F&psig=AOvVaw1c_RLJBuwpEcEM7aoNqWsv&ust=1646033788271000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAgQjRxqFwoTCIDF1PGvn_YCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD

ingredients : 
for dough
3/4 cup maida
1 tsp oil
salt to taste

for stuffing
1 tsp oil
3/4 cloves of finely chopped garlic
1 tsp finely chopped ginger
1/2 cup finely chopped carrot
1/2 cup finely chopped cabbage
1/4 cup finely chopped capsicum
1/4 cup finely chopped green french beans (Fanasi)
1/4 cup finely chopped green onion
1 tsp soy sauce
1 tsp chilli sauce
1/2 tsp black pepper powder
salt to taste

preparation time :
1 hour 30 min

method :
step-1 : add maida, oil and salt in a large bowl. mix all ingredients and soft pilable dough by adding water as needed. cover the dough and keep it aside for 20-25 minutes.

step-2 : Heat 1 tsp oil in a pan over medium flame. Add finely chopped ginger and garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add green onion and saute for a minute. 

step-3 : Add all chopped veggies and salt. mix well and saute them for 4-5 minutes. Add 1 tsp chilli sauce. Add 1/2 - 1 tsp soy sauce. Add 1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder. Mix well and sauté for a minute. Turn off the flame. Stuffing for Veg Momos is ready.

step-4 : Knead the dough again for a minute and divide it into 2-equal portions. Give each portion a round cylindrical shape like cucumber. Cut each one into 6-7 equal portions with a knife.

step-5 : Give each small portion a round shape like ball and flatten it a little into pattie by pressing it in between your palms. Cover them with a wet cloth or a plate to prevent them from drying.

step-6 : Place one dough pattie on a rolling board and roll it out into a thin disc (approx. 4-5 inch diameter). Roll it from sides and keep the center portion little thick compared to sides. If required, sprinkle some dry flour while rolling.

step-7 : Place approx. 1 tablespoon filling in the center. Don’t over-stuff it, otherwise it will be difficult to get a proper “potli” shape. Lift the edge from one side and start pleating (fold the edge a little inside and then little outside alternatively). Join them in the center to seal it.

step-8 : Prepare momos from remaining dough patties in a similar way.

step-9 : Grease a steamer plate or any other plate (it should easily fit into the steamer or a deep vessel) with oil to prevent them sticking. You can also line a plate with cabbage leaf instead of greasing the surface with oil. Arrange Veg Momos on a plate in a way that there is some space around them to expand.

step-10 : Heat 1-2 glass of water in a steamer or a deep vessel over medium flame.

step-11 : Place stand in the steamer and place momos plate over it. Momos should not touch the water. Cover the steamer/vessel with a lid and steam them for 6-7 minutes over medium flame or until they look little translucent and shiny. Remove the lid and check them by touching it. If they don’t feel sticky then it means they are cooked.

step-12 : Transfer them to a serving plate. Serve hot Veg Momos with Momos Chutney or Schezwan Sauce.

Tips :
You can choose any vegetable to make the stuffing. Enjoy momos while they are hot since its outer layer starts to turn hard/rubbery as it cools.

You can also use pressure cooker instead of steamer to steam the momos in a same way as described above. However, if you are using pressure cooker, don’t use the whistle while steaming the momos.

step-3 : Heat cooking oil in a pan. When oil is hot enough to deep fry, add and deep fry raw balls on medium flame until they turn golden brown.

step-4 : Drain oil from cooked balls and transfer to plate having paper towel spread on it (to remove excess oil from deep fried veg balls)

Garnish it with finely chopped spring onion for eye catchy appeal.

Chilli Paneer

ingredients :
250 gm paneer
1 teaspoon soy sauce
2 tablespoon tomato ketchup
salt as required
1 red bell pepper
1/2 cup onion
1 dash ginger powder
1 capsicum (green pepper)
1 teaspoon schezwan sauce
2 teaspoon ginger
2 teaspoon garlic paste
2 green chilli
1 teaspoon corn flour
1 teaspoon vinegar
1/2 cup refined oil
1 tablespoon green chilli sauce
1 yellow bell pepper
1 teaspoon butter

preparation time :
30 minutes

method :
step-1 : take a chopping board and chop the paneer, onion and bell peppers in small cubes. Wash the cubed bell peppers in running water and keep them aside. Now, peel ginger finely chop it in a small bowl. Then cut the green chillies into strips or you can also slice them in half.

step-2 : add paneer to a small bowl. Add cornflour, salt, ginger powder, vinegar and chilli paste in it. Marinate for 10-15 minutes. Next, put a skillet on medium flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, add the cubed paneer pieces in it and fry them till they turn golden in colour. Once done, keep them aside.

step-3 : put a saucepan on medium flame and add a little oil to it. Saute garlic paste, chopped ginger and slit green chillies in it. Add cubed bell peppers in it, saute for a minute then add onions to it. Next, add Schezwan sauce, tomato ketchup, green chilli sauce and soy sauce. Afterwards, add melted butter in it. Stir well and cook for two to three minutes. Finally, add the fried paneer cubes and toss them well.

step-4 : You can also add some extra water and let the sauce thicken if you want to make a glossy gravy or prepare semi-dry chilli paneer. Garnish with spring onions and enjoy hot.

tips :
The very first rule for making restaurant-style Chilli Paneer is that you must shallow fry the cottage cheese or paneer. Make sure you don’t over fry the paneer, as it can make it hard and chewy, while it should be soft and melt-in-the-mouth.

Cook all the veggies on high heat to keep them crunchy.

Spring Rolls

image : https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcookpad.com%2Fin%2Frecipes%2F15431923-veg-noodles-spring-rolls&psig=AOvVaw26N6tiRGB0-TYsFCwFHwe9&ust=1646044834163000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAgQjRxqFwoTCNiy74DZn_YCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAK

ingredients :
1 pack or 75 gram Instant Noodles
2 cup shredded cabbage
1/2 cup shredded carrots
1/3 cup thinly sliced capsicum
1/4 cup finely chopped french beans
1/3 cup spring onion
2 tbsp oil + for deep frying rolls
1/2 tsp finely chopped ginger
1 small garlic clove
1/2 tsp black pepper powder
1 tbsp soy sauce
salt to taste
6 tbsp maida or corn starch


preparation time :
1 Hour

method :
step-1 : First cook 75 grams instant noodles as per package instructions. Add the noodles to boiling water and cook them. You can use instant noodles or hakka noodles or any type of flour noodles. However do not use rice noodles or flat noodles. The noodles should be cooked until al dente.

step-2 : Then drain the noodles and rinse them thoroughly in fresh cold water.  Drain the water very well and set aside. From 75 grams of raw noodles, you will get about 1 cup cooked noodles.

step-3 : Chop, slice or shred the veggies in thin long strips. For cabbage and carrot, you can shred them using a box grater. Slice the green bell pepper/capsicum in thin strips or matchsticks. French beans can be sliced diagonally into long, thin strips.

step-4 : Once your veggies are prepped, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok or kadai. Keep the flame on medium heat and add ⅓ cup spring onion whites. At this point if you like, you can add about ½ teaspoon of minced or finely chopped ginger. You can also mince 1 small to medium garlic clove and add at this step.

step-5 : Stir and then add all the chopped veggies. Increase the heat to high and begin to stir fry the veggies. Stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes on a high heat. Do not cook the vegetables all through, but half cook them. They should still retain some crunch and bite.

step-6 : Then add ½ teaspoon crushed black pepper or pepper powder. Also add 1 teaspoon finely chopped celery (optional). Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Both black pepper and soy sauce can be adjusted as per your taste. Mix everything very well.

step-7 : Add the cooked noodles. Season with salt. Note that soy sauce is naturally quite salty, so be sure to adjust your seasoning with caution. Stir again very well.

step-8 : Switch off the heat and add 2 to 3 tablespoons of spring onion greens. You can add some herbs like chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) or fresh basil leaves at this point. Stir and keep the pan with the vegetable filling aside for it to cool at room temperature.

step-9 : In a bowl, mix 6 tablespoons all purpose flour or cornstarch and 4 to 5 tablespoons water. I used all-purpose flour. Whisk very well to make a thick paste without any lumps.

step-10 : Gently (but tightly) wrap and roll till the end to a cylindrical shape. Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards.

step-11 : Gently turn over the roll. Now spread some of the paste on the sides. Bring one side touching the roll and press gently. Do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges. I am comfortable rolling and sealing the spring rolls this way.

step-12 : In wok or frying pan, heat oil to deep frying temperature (180 to 190 degrees Celsius/356 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit). Keep the heat to medium. Gently slide in one spring roll to test. The oil should begin bubbling quite furiously. If the oil is not hot enough, then the spring rolls absorb oil and become soggy.

step-13 : Depending on the size of the pan or wok, you can fry 2 to 3 veg spring rolls at a time. Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side.

step-14 : Fry them till they are crisp and golden turning over as needed. The spring rolls fry quickly, so keep a close eye on them as they cook. Remove with a slotted spoon. Drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.

step-15 : Garnish with some chopped spring onion greens or fresh cilantro leaves. Serve the veg spring rolls hot with any dipping sauce of your choice.
